# HadronRiddles

I this repository I collect problems and riddles related to particle physics / scattering theory
They are unsolved, but likely possible to solve.

The AI are getting more advanced,
it'd be curious to see how long these problems stand unsolved.

## Projects

A work on any project a) requires solving the riddle, b) searching literature for relevant material, c) writing report / paper / blog post.

### 1. Chew-Mandestam of high orbital angular momemtum.

The problem is to calculate an analytic expression for CM functions with Blatt-Weisskopf form-factor for L>0.

See detailed [description](analytic-chew-mandelstam.md).

### 2. `Bz-Ry-Rz` vs cross-product `Y_new = Z_old x Z_new`

Two conventions on calculating helicity angles give diffent result for four-body topology. One has to undestand differences and concequences

### 3. Circular Dalitz plot

Find a conformal tranformation of a Dalitz plot to a unit circle.

### 4. Analytic continuation of 3body equations

Fig. 14 in the [a1(1260) paper](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1696497) presents the problem. There are two options for analytic continuation and none seems natural.
